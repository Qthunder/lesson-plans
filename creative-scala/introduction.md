It's likely that most of your time will be taken up with installation issues. If you do get a chance to work on code go for an easy win. Take the `Example` in the Creative Scala template and ask the students to modify it. Getting them working together is probably a good idea. They'll make mistakes and this is a good place to discuss error recovery (in the sense of how the programmer recovers from mistakes---reading the compiler messages, reading the code, etc.)
