# Structural Recursion

## Overview {:teacher:}

Core concept: transformation of an algebraic data type. The structure of the transform follows the structure of the data.
Scala features:
- pattern matching
- polymorphism

Rule: any time you need to transform an algebraic data type you can implement this transform using structural recursion.


## Introduction {:present:}

Example ADT and transform on it.
